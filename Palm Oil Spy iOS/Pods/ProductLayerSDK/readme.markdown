ProductLayer SDK for iOS
========================

The ultimate product information API, enabling a new breed of [product-centric apps](http://www.cocoanetics.com/2014/02/from-barcodes-to-productlayer/). This is the iOS SDK for it. It is Open Source so that you can see how easy it is to use it in your own apps.

You can sign up for a developer account at [api.productlayer.com](http://api.productlayer.com)

Documentation coming soon, have a look at the included Demo app in the meantime.

To clone the project with all the sub-modules execute the following command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ProductLayer/ProductLayer-SDK-for-iOS.git
```

Apps using this SDK
-------------------

We love to highlight apps using the ProductLayer SDK. The first app using it is prod.ly the [official client app for the prod.ly social network](https://prod.ly/app/).
